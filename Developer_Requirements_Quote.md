## Important Notes for Developer

### Strategic Positioning
- This is **NOT an ecommerce site** - no shopping cart, no "buy now" buttons
- All product pages have "Request Quote" or "Schedule Consultation" CTAs
- Goal is to drive visitors to contact/consultation, not online purchases
- Emphasis on expertise and consultation over product catalog

### Template Reusability
- **Industry pages** all follow same template (8 pages, same structure)
- **Partner pages** all follow same template (6 pages, same structure)
- **Product category pages** similar structure (4 pages)
- Developer can create templates and duplicate with content swap

### Content Complexity
- Long-form content on many pages (lots of text)
- Multiple sections per page (6-10 sections typical)
- Heavy use of cards, grids, and multi-column layouts
- Many images per page

### Forms Critical
- Contact form is the PRIMARY conversion point
- Must work flawlessly on mobile and desktop
- Email notifications are essential
- Spam protection required
