Expert Insight from Michael Schiller
```

**QUOTE:**
```
"OM Seating consistently delivers on the promise of ergonomic excellence.
When I conduct assessments for healthcare facilities or corporate offices,
OM chairs are often my first recommendation because I know they'll provide
the adjustability, durability, and comfort my clients need.

What sets OM apart is their commitment to real ergonomic engineering—not
just marketing buzzwords. Features like multi-position tilt, adjustable
lumbar support, and 4D armrests actually make a difference for people
working long hours. And the fact that they offer antimicrobial, cleanable
options for healthcare makes them invaluable in clinical settings.

If you're investing in commercial seating, you want furniture that will
last and truly support your team's well-being. That's exactly what OM
Seating delivers."
