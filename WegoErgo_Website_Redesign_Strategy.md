# WegoErgo Website Redesign Strategy
**Complete Redesign for Squarespace Implementation**

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Problems Identified
1. **Confusing Navigation** - Terms like "SANDBOX", "VIRTUAL SHOWROOMS", "MORE" don't communicate clear value
2. **Unclear Value Proposition** - Visitors don't immediately understand what WegoErgo does
3. **Partner Confusion** - No clear strategy for showcasing furniture partners without being an ecommerce site
4. **Poor Conversion Path** - No clear journey from visitor to lead
5. **Overwhelming Structure** - Too many menu items and unclear hierarchy
6. **Lack of Clarity** - Business model (assessments + furniture representation) is not clearly communicated

### Core Business Model
WegoErgo operates on a **dual-service model**:
1. **Professional Services**: Certified ergonomic assessments, program reviews, and on-site/virtual training
2. **Product Representation**: Representing top commercial furniture manufacturers (OM Seating, LoneStar Ergonomics, Workrite, etc.) plus education partnerships (Worksite International)

**Key Differentiator**: Personalized fitting process ensures clients get equipment that meets neutral posture specifications, avoiding costly returns and aggravation. Focus on curated "Top Dozen" recommendations, not full catalog.

**Important**: NOT an ecommerce site. Works with dealers, designers, and installers for turnkey solutions.

---

## Strategic Positioning

### Clear Value Proposition
**"Expert Ergonomic Assessments + Access to Top Commercial Furniture Brands"**

WegoErgo is the bridge between businesses needing ergonomic solutions and the best furniture manufacturers in the industry. Michael's expertise ensures clients get the right solutions, not just products.

### Target Audience
- Healthcare facilities
- Government agencies
- Corporate offices (especially Bay Area tech)
- Educational institutions
- Small businesses
- Hospitality businesses
- Lab & life science facilities

## Solving the Partner Problem

### The Strategic Solution

**Create a "Products & Partners" section that positions WegoErgo as the curator/expert, not a catalog.**

#### Approach:
1. **Lead with expertise, not products**
   - "We partner with the industry's leading manufacturers to bring you the best ergonomic solutions"
   - Emphasize Michael's role in selecting the RIGHT products for each client

2. **Partner Brand Pages** (instead of external links)
   - Create beautiful brand partner pages on YOUR site
   - Showcase each partner's strengths
   - Feature select products with compelling imagery
   - CTA: "Schedule Assessment" or "Request Quote" (NOT "Buy Now")
   - Optional: "Visit [Brand] Website" as secondary action

3. **Product Categories** (not ecommerce)
   - Show products organized by type (seating, desks, accessories)
   - Each product has:
     - Beautiful image
     - Key features
     - "Why Michael recommends this"
     - CTA: "Discuss this solution" or "Include in my assessment"

4. **No Pricing** (creates conversion opportunity)
   - "Contact us for pricing and delivery"
   - Positions you as B2B consultant, not retailer
   - Forces conversation = better conversion

### Example Partner Page Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   OM SEATING - PREMIUM ERGONOMIC CHAIRS  │
│                                          │

│   a leader in commercial ergonomic       │
│   seating for healthcare, corporate,     │
│   and education environments...          │
│                                          │
│   [3-4 Featured Products with Images]   │
│   [Contact for Pricing CTA]              │
│   [Optional: Visit OM Seating Website]   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## The "Top Dozen" Product Strategy

### Curated Over Comprehensive

**Problem**: Trying to showcase every product from every manufacturer creates an overwhelming catalog that doesn't serve the client's needs.

**Solution**: Feature a curated "Top Dozen" (~12 products) that Michael recommends most often.

#### Benefits:
1. **Manageable**: Easier to maintain and update
2. **Focused**: Highlights best-in-class solutions
3. **Expert positioning**: "These are MY top recommendations"
4. **Reduces decision fatigue**: Clients aren't overwhelmed
5. **Personalization hook**: "Don't see what you need? Let's discuss your specific situation"

#### Implementation:
- Create dedicated "Top Dozen Spotlight" page
- Feature these products prominently on category pages
- Each product gets detailed writeup with Michael's recommendation
- Include: Why he recommends it, ideal use cases, key specifications
- CTA: "Request personalized fitting consultation"

### Worksite International Partnership

**Different from product partners** - Worksite International is a **schooling/education partner**, not a furniture manufacturer.

#### Strategy:
- Separate section or page explaining this partnership
- Position as: "Continuing education and training partner"
- Services offered through this partnership:
  - On-site ergonomic training
  - Virtual training sessions
  - Certification programs for clients
  - Ongoing education resources
- Link to training services page
- Distinct visual treatment from product partners
